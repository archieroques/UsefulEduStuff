# UsefulEduStuff
A collection of educational worksheets etc that are free for others to download, share and use. 

I've made these things at various points in time and other people have expressed an interest in using them, so I'm sticking the here for the good of the world. Knowledge is power, yo. 

Oh yeah, they're under CC-BY-SA so you can share them and mess with them if you want. Ping me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/archieroques) if you spot a mistake or anything...
